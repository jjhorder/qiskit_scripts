# qiskit_scripts
Computing quantum circuits in python using qiskit.
I like to use jupyter qtconsole as a scratch pad. After the drafting stage I'll write up polished script in an editor. At this stage these scripts will be written with the intent to run them in a qtconsole, so that figures are plotted inline.
